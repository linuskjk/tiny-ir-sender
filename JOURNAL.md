## 10/15/2025 - Finished schematic  

I had the idea and gathered all the parts. Then I looked for a library for the SSD1306 display I got, but unfortunately couldn't find one. So I created the symbol and footprint myself. There was no library for the IR transmitter either, so I created the symbol and footprint again by measuring and reading datasheets. Next I'm going to create the layout and route the circuit board.

## 10/16/2025 - Aligned the components and routed the PCB  

I aligned all the components the way I wanted them, which was quite stressful since they're all very close together and stacked on top of each other. After I finished that part, I started routing the circuit board, which wasn't too difficult due to the small number of pins and connectors. Now I'm optimizing the circuit board and then letting PCBWay do its work.

## 10/17/2025 - Optimized and ordered PCB  

After adjusting some traces and ensuring that all components fit perfectly, I exported all the Gerber and drilling files. I then went to PCBway, configured all the PCB settings, and sent it in for review. After a few minutes, it was approved, and I ordered it.

## 10/19/2025 - Read IR data of the remote and created database  

I got myself an Arduino Uno and an IR receiver module and read each command and its raw data.

After that, I saved all the information in a TXT file for easier reading. Next, I'll program the code to select between the individual commands on the display.

## 10/20/2025 - Build a prototype  

I took an Arduino Uno, an ssd1306 display, an IR transmitter and some buttons. Then I built a prototype of the project and programmed the first display layouts. At the moment you still can't control anything with the keys, so this will be the next step.
