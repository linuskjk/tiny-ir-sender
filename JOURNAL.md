## 10/15/2025 - Finished schematic  

I had the idea and gathered all the parts. Then I looked for a library for the SSD1306 display I got, but unfortunately couldn't find one. So I created the symbol and footprint myself. There was no library for the IR transmitter either, so I created the symbol and footprint again by measuring and reading datasheets. Next I'm going to create the layout and route the circuit board.

## 10/16/2025 - Aligned the components and routed the PCB  

I aligned all the components the way I wanted them, which was quite stressful since they're all very close together and stacked on top of each other. After I finished that part, I started routing the circuit board, which wasn't too difficult due to the small number of pins and connectors. Now I'm optimizing the circuit board and then letting PCBWay do its work.
