## 10/15/2025 - Finished schematic  

I had the idea and gathered all the parts. Then I looked for a library for the SSD1306 display I got, but unfortunately couldn't find one. So I created the symbol and footprint myself. There was no library for the IR transmitter either, so I created the symbol and footprint again by measuring and reading datasheets. Next I'm going to create the layout and route the circuit board.
